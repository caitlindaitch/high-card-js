Pseudocode:

Creating a deck:

Array containing values
Array containing suits

var name = prompt("What is your name?")

Game function
  Establish a new array called Deck (or object?) to contain the combination of suits and values that will create the deck of cards

  Set the variable "m" equal to the length of values * suits

  For all values starting with zero, for the length of m, and incrementing by 1 each time
    Push the index of the value array WITH the index value of the suits array until the value array is finished, then iterate through the next suit. (Would this require two for loops?? How do you get this working?)

  Loop through each index value of the array
    Use math.Random to randomize the placement of each item in the array

  Create an array players, push one additional player to the array if prompted to do so

  Loop through the player array and use math.Random to assign a random value to each player
    Define math.Random by associating each return value with a different playing card value

  Compare all values with one another
    if player[0] > player[1] && player[0] > player [2]
      alert(name + " won the game with " + winning player's card)
